## Summary

The dataset used for this regression model is '**Restaurant Revenue Prediction**'. The goal of this model is to predict the Monthly revenue of the restaurant based on the number of customers eating in that restaurant. Since it is a Linear regression model, there can be only one input. The Model is built using Python in **Google colab** platform. The data is divided into training set and test set.
